CineMate: AI-Powered Conversational Movie Recommender
CineMate is an intelligent, chat-based movie recommendation system designed to overcome the limitations of traditional platforms. By leveraging Generative AI, LangChain, and vector search, it understands natural language queries to provide personalized, context-aware, and explainable movie suggestions
ðŸš© The Problem
In the age of streaming, users often face "decision fatigue" from scrolling through vast movie catalogs. Traditional recommendation systems, which typically rely on basic metadata or collaborative filtering, often produce repetitive and impersonal suggestions. They struggle to understand a user's specific mood, emotional intent, or complex thematic preferences, failing to answer queries like, "I want something like Interstellar but more emotional"


âœ¨ The Solution
CineMate addresses this gap by providing a generative AI-powered solution that can:

Understand Natural Language: Interpret complex, conversational user queries to grasp mood, genre, and similarity preferences.



Provide Context-Aware Suggestions: Use a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline with GPT and LangChain to fetch relevant movie data and generate accurate recommendations.




Deliver Explainable Results: Generate recommendations in a conversational style, explaining why a particular movie is a good match for the user's request
